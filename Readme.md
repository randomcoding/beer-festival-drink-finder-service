# Beer Festival Drink Finder Web Service

This is an application that enables a Beer Festival to provide a means of searching for available drinks at the festival.

This services provides three main funnctions:

1. Festival goers can search the currently available drinks by name, type, abd price etc. to find their next drink.
1. Festival organisers can upload the current status of their drinks (Beer, Cider, Perry, Wine etc.) via a Spreadsheet upload function.
1. It provides the backing datastore for the [Android Client](https://github.com/randomcoding/beer-festival-drink-finder-for-android)

----

The app itself runs on cloudfoundry (at http://beerfestivaldrinkfinder.cloudfoundry.com) and was successfully run last year (2011) at 
[**Worcester CAMRA Beer, Cider and Perry Festival**](http://worcesterbeerfest.org.uk) as well as at the 
[Chappel Beer Festival](http://www.chappelbeerfestival.co.uk)
